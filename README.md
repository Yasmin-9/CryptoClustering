# CryptoClustering

This activity uses supervised learning to predict if crypto-currencies are affected by price changes. 

Data was retrieved from crypto_market_data.csv, prepared and then scaled. The data was clustered using two methods: 
1. With K-means using the original data 
2. With Principal Component Analysis 

The two clustering methods were compared and the code can be viewed in Crypto_Clustering.ipynb
